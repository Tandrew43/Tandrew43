This Part of the Project is inputing CSV file into Google Colab. 
The Goal in this project is to create a Dataframe using GoogleColab.
 First Off, I ask GoogleColab to create a panda dataframe for my Pizz?Pizza! csv file '/content/Pizza_Pizza_sales_data.csv'
 By printing out the dataframe (df), This will show what the CSV file saved. 
 For creating files in the Google Colab, I asked questions using Google Gemini. 
 By the help of Google Gemini in Google Colab, I was able to set a prompt like "calculate the average number of customers per store", "What is the Smallest store with customer wise and sale wise", "create a visualizing Graph", and more. 

In Summary, This was a fun Project to create a Python code and dataframe on Google Colab. 
 I wouldn't be able to do this without my Professors help, Professor Stefan Bund. 
 Thank you very much Professor.
