In this First project, I worked on creating a Pizza Company using Python code for the Project. Creating several Classes in a category in Product, Order, Customer, Store, and Corporation.
  Product Class contains the Pizza's size, meat, cheese, and topping. Also, Created a pricing on every different prodcuts LIST into "price_dict"
and size, meat, cheese, and topping into "ingredient" LIST. 
  In the "Customer" class, this represents a customer with a name, ID, and associated orders. It also allow customers to create an order, add products and calculate the total cost. 
  "Order" Class, represents customer's orders. This also adds Product to the orders, each orders has an random set of "order_id".
  "Inventory" Class, holds the list of products available in the store and generates 20 random products when inventory is created.
  Store Class, represents "Store" with "Customer" and "Inventory".
  Corporation Class, manages multiple stores using self.stores = []  
When creating this project I used a help of multiple LLM such as Copilot, CHatGPT, and GoogleColab.

IN Summary, This code simulates a Pizza restaurant chain name Pizza? Pizza! with store, customers, and products. This Generates random product orders
for customers and logs sales into CSV file with timestamp.
